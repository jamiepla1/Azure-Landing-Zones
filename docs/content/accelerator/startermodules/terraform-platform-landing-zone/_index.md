title: Terraform - Azure Verified Modules for Platform Landing Zone (ALZ)
geekdocCollapseSection: true
---

The `platform_landing_zone` starter module deploys the end to end platform landing zone using Azure Verified Modules. It is fully configurable to meet different scenarios.

This documentation covers the top scenarios and documents all available configuration settings for this module.

We aim to cover 80% of common scenarios. If the particular scenario is not covered here, it may be possible to adjust the configuration settings to match the requirements. If not, then it my be the case you need to adjust their Terraform code post bootstrap.

This documentation covers the following:

* [Usage](#usage): How to use this starter module
* [Scenarios](#scenarios): The scenarios supported with example configuration files
* [Options](#options): Common customization tasks and how to perform them are documented here
* [Platform landing zone configuration file](#platform-landing-zone-configuration-file): Comprehensive documentation of the available input variables
* [Azure Verified Modules Reference](#azure-verified-modules-reference): A reference list and explanation of the Azure Verified Modules used in this starter module 

## Usage

To use the starter module, follow the detailed steps documented in phases 1, 2, and 3 of the [Accelerator]({{< relref "/accelerator/userguide" >}}). Here we cover come specifics of this starter module.

There are 3 sets of configuration that can be supplied to the accelerator to pre-configure it.

The available configuration inputs are:

* [Bootstrap Configuration File](#bootstrap-configuration-file)
* [Platform Landing Zone Configuration File](#platform-landing-zone-configuration-file)
* [Platform Landing Zone Library (lib) Folder](#platform-landing-zone-library-lib-folder)

### Bootstrap Configuration File

This is the YAML file used to provide the base configuration required to bootstrap your version control system and Azure. 

Some of this configuration is also fed into this starter module. You will see a `terraform.tfvars.json` file is created to hold these inputs. They include management group ID, subscriptions IDs, starter locations, etc.

We provide examples of this file for each version control system. These can be found in the [Phase 2]({{< relref "/accelerator/userguide/2_start" >}}) documentation, but are also listed here for convenience:

* Azure DevOps: [inputs-azure-devops.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/refs/heads/main/templates/platform_landing_zone/examples/bootstrap/inputs-azure-devops.yaml)
* GitHub: [inputs-github.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/refs/heads/main/templates/platform_landing_zone/examples/bootstrap/inputs-github.yaml)
* Local: [inputs-local.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/refs/heads/main/templates/platform_landing_zone/examples/bootstrap/inputs-local.yaml)

### Platform Landing Zone Configuration File

This is the `tfvars` file in HCL format that determines which resources are deployed and what type of hub networking connectivity is deployed.

This file is validated by the accelerator and then directly copied to your repository, so it retains the ordering, comments, etc. You will see the file is renamed to `*.auto.tfvars`, so that it is automatically picked up by Terraform.

We provide examples of this file for each scenario. These can be found in the [scenarios](#scenarios) documentation.

### Platform Landing Zone Library (lib) Folder

This is a folder of configuration files used to customize the management groups and associated policies. This library and its usage is documented alongside the `avm-ptn-alz` module. However, we cover a common customization use case in our [How To](#how-to) section.

By default we supply an empty `lib` folder. This folder can be overridden with a set of files to customize Management Groups and Policy Assignments. Use cases include:

* Renaming management groups
* Customizing the management group structure
* Removing policy assignments
* Adding custom policy definitions and assignments

The detailed documentation for the library and it's usage can be found here:

* Platform Landing Zone Library Documentation: https://azure.github.io/Azure-Landing-Zones-Library/
* Azure Verified Module for Management Groups and Policy: https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-ptn-alz/azurerm/0.10.0

## Options

The options section details how to make configuration changes that apply to the common scenarios.

The available options are:

* [Customize Management Group Names and IDs](#customize-management-group-names-and-ids)
* [Turn off DDOS protection plan](#turn-off-ddos-protection-plan)
* [Turn off Bastion host](#turn-off-bastion-host)

* [Turn off Virtual Network Gateways](#turn-off-virtual-network-gateways)
* [Additional Regions](#additional-regions)
* [IP Address Ranges](#ip-address-ranges)

### Customize Management Group Names and IDs

You may want to customize the management groups names and IDs. In order to do this they need to supply a `lib` folder to the accelerator.

The `lib` folder should contain the following structure (we are showing it nested under the standard accelerator file structure here):

```plaintext
📂accelerator
┣ 📂config
┃ ┣ 📂lib
┃ ┃ ┗ 📂architecture_definitions
┃ ┃   ┗ 📜alz.alz_architecture_definition.json
┃ ┗ 📜inputs.yaml
┗ 📂output
```
{{< hint type=warning >}}
The `lib` folder must be named `lib`, any other name will not work
{{< /hint >}}

The `alz.alz_architecture_definition.json` file content should be copied from [here](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Landing-Zones-Library/blob/main/platform/alz/architecture_definitions/alz.alz_architecture_definition.json).

You can then edit this configuration file to update the management group names and IDs. 

For example to prefix all the management group display names with `Contoso` and update the management group IDs to have the `contoso-` prefix they can update the file to look like this:

{{< include file="/static/examples/tf/accelerator/config/lib/architecture_definitions/alz.alz_architecture_definition.json" language="json" >}}

{{< hint type=tip >}}
When updating the management group `id`, you also need to consider any child management groups that refer to it by the `parent_id`
{{< /hint >}}

Now, when deploying the accelerator they need to supply their lib folder as an argument with `starterAdditionalFiles`:

```pwsh
Deploy-Accelerator -inputs "c:\accelerator\config\inputs.yaml", "c:\accelerator\config\networking.yaml" -starterAdditionalFiles "c:\accelerator\config\lib" -output "c:\accelerator\output"
```

### Turn off DDOS protection plan

You can choose to not deploy a DDOS protection plan. In order to do that, they need to remove the DDOS protection plan configuration and disable the DINE (deploy if not exists) policy. You can either comment out or remove the configuration entirely.

{{< hint type=warning >}}
DDOS Protection plan is a critical security protection for public facing services. Carefully consider this and be sure to put in place an alternative solution, such as per IP protection.

          enforcement_mode = "DoNotEnforce"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
1. Remove the whole `ddos_protection_plan` section from `hub_and_spoke_vnet_settings` or `virtual_wan_settings`

### Turn off Bastion host

You can choose to not deploy a Bastion Host. In order to do that, they need to remove the Bastion Host configuration. You can either comment out or remove the configuration entirely.

The steps to follow are:

1. To keep the code tidy remove the follow settings from `custom_replacements.names`:
  1. `<region>_bastion_subnet_address_prefix` where `<region>` is for each region
1. Remove the whole `bastion` section from each `hub_and_spoke_vnet_virtual_networks` or `virtual_wan_virtual_hubs` region

### Turn off Private DNS zones and Private DNS resolver

You can choose to not deploy any DNS related resources. In order to do that, they need to remove the DNS configuration and disable the DINE (deploy if not exists) policy. You can either comment out or remove the configuration entirely.

The steps to follow are:

1. To keep the code tidy remove the follow settings from `custom_replacements.names`:
  1. `dns_resource_group_name`
  1. `<region>_private_dns_resolver_subnet_address_prefix` where `<region>` is for each region
1. Remove the follow configuration settings from `management_group_settings.policy_default_values`:
  1. `private_dns_zone_subscription_id`
  1. `private_dns_zone_region`

1. Add the follow section to `management_group_settings.policy_assignments_to_modify`:

    ```terraform
    corp = {
      policy_assignments = {
        Deploy-Private-DNS-Zones = {
          enforcement_mode = "DoNotEnforce"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Remove the whole `private_dns_zones` section from each `hub_and_spoke_vnet_virtual_networks` or `virtual_wan_virtual_hubs` region

### Turn off Virtual Network Gateways

You can choose to not deploy any Virtual Network Gateways. In order to do that, you need to remove the Virtual Network Gateway configuration. You can either comment out or remove the configuration entirely.

The steps to follow are:

1.  To keep the code tidy remove the follow settings from `custom_replacements.names`:
  1. `<region>_gateway_subnet_address_prefix` where `<region>` is for each region
1. Remove the whole `virtual_network_gateways` section from each `hub_and_spoke_vnet_virtual_networks` or `virtual_wan_virtual_hubs` region

You can also just turn off the specific Virtual Network Gateway types you don't want to deploy.

For ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateways:

1. Remove the whole `express_route` section from the `virtual_network_gateways` section in each `hub_and_spoke_vnet_virtual_networks` or `virtual_wan_virtual_hubs` region

For VPN Virtual Network Gateways:

1. Remove the whole `vpn` section from the `virtual_network_gateways` section in each `hub_and_spoke_vnet_virtual_networks` or `virtual_wan_virtual_hubs` region

### Additional Regions

Additional regions are supported. The custom can add up to 10 regions using the out of the box module.

{{< hint type=tip >}}
If you need to scale beyond 10 regions, that can be accommodated by adding additional built in replacements [here](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/blob/cf0b37351cd4f2dde9d2cf20642d76bacadf923c/templates/platform_landing_zone/locals.config.tf#L2)
{{< /hint >}}

To add an additional regions, the process is `copy` -> `paste` -> `update`:

1. Copy, paste and update the regional resource group names in `custom_replacements.names`
1. Copy, paste and update the regional IP Ranges in `custom_replacements.names`
1. Copy, paste and update the regional resource group in `connectivity_resource_groups`
1. Copy, paste and update the region in `hub_and_spoke_vnet_virtual_networks` or `virtual_wan_virtual_hubs`

### IP Address Ranges

The example configuration files that include connectivity include an out of the box set of ip address ranges. These ranges have been chosen to support a real world scenario with optimal use to avoid ip exhaustion as you scale. However you may not want to use these ranges if they may overlap with their existing ranges or they are planning to scale beyond the /16 per region we cater for.

In order to update the IP ranges, you can update the `custom_replacements.names` section that includes the IP ranges. For example if you prefer to use `172.16` or `192.168`, they could update the ranges as follows:

{{< include file="/static/examples/tf/accelerator/config/custom_replacements.names.ip_ranges.tfvars" language="terraform" >}}

## Platform landing zone configuration file

This section details the available configuration settings / variables in this starter module.

### Custom Replacements (`custom_replacements`)

The `custom_replacements` variable builds on the built-in replacements to provide user defined replacements that can be used throughout your configuration. This reduces the complexity of the configuration file by allowing re-use of names and other definitions that may be repeated throughout the configuration. 

There are 4 layers of replacements that can be built upon to provide the level of flexibility you need. The order of precedence determines which other replacements can be used to build your replacement. For example a 'Name' replacement can be used to build a 'Resource Group Identifier' replacement, but a 'Resource Group Identifier' replacement cannot be used to build a 'Name' replacement.

The layers and precedence order is:

1. Built-in Replacements: These can be found at the top of our example config files and you can also see them in the code base [here](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/blob/cf0b37351cd4f2dde9d2cf20642d76bacadf923c/templates/platform_landing_zone/locals.config.tf#L2)
2. Names: This is for resource names and other basic strings
3. Resource Group Identifiers: This is for resource group IDs
4. Resource Identifiers: This is for resource IDs

#### Names (`custom_replacements.names`)

### Virtual WAN Virtual Hubs (`virtual_wan_virtual_hubs`)

The `hub_and_spoke_vnet_virtual_networks` variable is used to set the regional settings for the Virtual WAN connectivity options. This includes Virtual WAN Hubs, Firewalls, Virtual Network Gateways, Bastion Hosts, Private DNS Zones, and Private DNS Resolver

This variable is of type `map(object)`. Some of the object properties map directly to the Azure Verified Module variables. To determine what can be supplied to these variable you can refer to the documentation for this module directly.

The `map(object)` definition can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/alz-terraform-accelerator/blob/cf0b37351cd4f2dde9d2cf20642d76bacadf923c/templates/platform_landing_zone/modules/hub-and-spoke-vnet/variables.tf#L14).

The supported object properties are:

* `hub`: This `object` maps directly to the `virtual_hubs` variable of the Azure Verified Module, which can be found here: [registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-ptn-virtualwan](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-ptn-virtualwan/azurerm/0.5.3?tab=inputs)
* `firewall`: This `object` maps directly to the `firewalls` variable of the Azure Verified Module, which can be found here: [registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-ptn-virtualwan](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-ptn-virtualwan/azurerm/0.5.3?tab=inputs)
* `firewall_policy`: This `object` maps directly to the Azure Verified Module, which can be found here: [registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-res-network-firewallpolicy](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-res-network-firewallpolicy/azurerm/0.2.3?tab=inputs)
* `bastion`: This an `object` to specify the Bastion Host settings (omit this object if you don't want to deploy a Bastion Host)
  * `subnet_address_prefix`: The Bastion Host subnet address space
  * `bastion_host`: This `object` maps directly to the variables of the Azure Verified Module, which can be found here: [registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-res-network-bastionhost](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-res-network-bastionhost/azurerm/0.3.1?tab=inputs)
  * `bastion_public_ip`: This `object` maps directly to the variables of the Azure Verified Module, which can be found here: [registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-res-network-publicipaddress](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-res-network-publicipaddress/azurerm/0.1.2?tab=inputs) 
* `virtual_network_gateways`: This an `object` to specify the Virtual Network Gateways settings (omit this object if you don't want to deploy any Virtual Network Gateways)
  * `express_route`: This `object` maps directly to the `expressroute_gateways` variable of the Azure Verified Module, which can be found here: [registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-ptn-virtualwan](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-ptn-virtualwan/azurerm/0.5.3?tab=inputs)
  * `vpn`: This `object` maps directly to the `vpn_gateways` variable of the Azure Verified Module, which can be found here: [registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-ptn-virtualwan](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-ptn-virtualwan/azurerm/0.5.3?tab=inputs)
* `private_dns_zones`: This an `object` to specify the Private DNS Zone settings (omit this object if you don't want to deploy any Private DNS Zones)
  * `subnet_address_prefix`: The Private DNS Resolver subnet address space
  * `resource_group_name`: The name of the resource group to deploy the Private DNS Zones into
  * `is_primary`: Whether this is the primary region. Any non-regional Private Link Private DNS Zones will be deployed into this region. Although the Private DNS Zones are a global resource, their meta-data needs to reside in a specific region.
  * `private_link_private_dns_zones`: This is a `map(object)` used to override the Private Link Private DNS Zones that are deployed, leave this empty to deploy the default set of zones specified by ALZ
    * `zone_name`: The name of the Private DNS Zone to deploy
  * `auto_registration_zone_enabled`: Whether to deploy the Virtual Machine auto-registration Private DNS Zone
  * `auto_registration_zone_name`: The name of the Virtual Machine auto-registration Private DNS Zone
  * `private_dns_resolver`: This is an `object` to specify the Private DNS Resolver
    * `name`: The name of the Private DNS Resolver
    * `resource_group_name`: The name of the resource group to deploy the Private DNS Resolver into
    * `ip_address`: The static IP Address of the Private DNS Resolver. This will be auto calculated if not supplied
* `side_car_virtual_network`: This `object` maps directly to the variables of the Azure Verified Module, which can be found here: [registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-res-network-virtualnetwork](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/avm-res-network-virtualnetwork/azurerm/0.7.1?tab=inputs)
