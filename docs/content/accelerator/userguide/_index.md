## Quick Start

For the majority of users, this is the place to start. The quick start is a step by step guide to get your Azure Landing Zone environment up and running.

Now head to [Get Started](#get-started).

## Advanced Users

For those users with very specific requirements we provide some advanced capabilities that allow you to override some of the defaults.

See our [FAQ]({{< relref "faq" >}}) and [Advanced Scenarios]({{< relref "advancedscenarios" >}}) for more info.

## Get Started

This guide takes you through the steps to prepare your prerequisites and then run the PowerShell module.

The accelerator bootstraps a continuous delivery environment for you. It supports both the Azure DevOps and GitHub version control system (VCS). It uses the [ALZ PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ALZ) to gather required user input and apply a Terraform module to configure the bootstrap environment.

The accelerator quick start follows a 3 phase approach, with an optional planning and decisions phase:

If this is your first time running the accelerator, we recommend starting with [phase 0]({{< relref "0_planning" >}}) to make some decisions and get a better understanding before you start.
{{< /hint >}}

- [Phase 0]({{< relref "0_planning" >}}): Planning and decisions to make before starting.
- [Phase 1]({{< relref "1_prerequisites" >}}): Instructions to configure credentials and subscriptions.
- [Phase 2]({{< relref "2_start" >}}): Run the PowerShell module to generate the continuous delivery environment.
- [Phase 3]({{< relref "3_deploy" >}}): Update the module (if needed) to suit the needs of your organization and deploy via continuous delivery.
